# Test Cases

This chapter collects critical use cases which should be checked against the grid specification.

## Separate ground path via audio or USB connection

Phone connected to one nanogrid controller, sound system to another. An audio / USB cable connects both devices.

## Multiple inverters connected in different locations to public grid

Are inverters always galvanically isolated? If not, does it create issues in the grid?

## Different grounding of connected existing SHS

Typical PWM charge controllers are grounded at positive terminal (if grounded at all). MPPT charge controllers might be grounded at negative terminal. What happens if batteries of both of these systems are connected to the nanogrid?
