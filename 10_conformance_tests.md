# Annex C: Conformance Tests

[Normative]

This defines a series of tests that a device must pass to be considered Open DC Grid conforming.
The tests required depend on what functionality the device performs and what ports it implements.

In many cases, these tests are similar to tests required by existing standards such ISO 16750.
They are repeated here, in a functionally equivalent form,
so that implementers do not need to purchase standards from other bodies.
In some cases, tests have been specifically modified to be more appropriate to the ODG environment
as opposed to other environments such as an automobile. Any modifications
to existing standards are clearly noted. Devices that need to conform to other standards
should purchase those standards and use the testing process required by those standards.
